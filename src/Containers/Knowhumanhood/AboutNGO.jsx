          We all believe that service to humanity is as equal to serving god. We
          are a team of aspiring and inspiring youth. We are continuously
          imposing our efforts to make this world a better place. We try our
          best to deliver aid, care and relief. H20 - Human Hood organization is
          an NGO that came into existence in 2017 and still contributing for a
          major cause. A small initiative taken by a couple of kids a few years
          back has now become a determined vision that is supported and
          appreciated at every step. We get to know that people are losing their
          life due to unavailability of blood. Then we marked the crisis in lack
          of awareness for blood donation. So we geared up to create awareness
          activities and organizing blood donation camps with the support of
          Medical professionals and Government officials. From being in Kerala
          in the September 2018 floods then being in Darbangha in the July 2019
          Bihar floods and then in October 2019 Patna floods our team has fought
          it’s way through every disaster. From providing blood, arranging bed
          for the patient and making the oxygen supply possible to the needful
          and safe guarded everyone in the pandemic of 2020. Hoping to continue
          the good work and wish to get you’re never ending support.
